## :information_source: About

The application was developed using React Native, making it usable on both iOS and Android devices. On its initial screen, the user is presented with a list of cards displaying the title of each quiz along with its difficulty level. At the top of the screen, it's possible to filter the quizzes by difficulty, toggling between easy, medium, and hard.

In the top right corner of the screen, there's also a trophy icon that allows the user to access their answer history. These are organized by the most recent quizzes answered.
